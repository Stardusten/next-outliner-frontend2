- What is a distributed system?
  - A system running on several nodes connected by a network, characterized by partial failure.
  - Failures
    - There are two pholosophies when dealing with failures:
      - High-Performance Computing (HPC) philosophy:
        - treat partial failure as total failure
        - checkpointing
      - "cloud computing" philosophy:
        - treat partial failure as expected
        - work around the failure
        - "everything fails, all the time"
    - Failure example
      - Consider a system with M1, M2. M1 asks M2 for the value of x.
      - M1 -- x? --> M2
      - M1 <- x=5 -- M2
      - During process above, potential failures include:
        - request from M1 is lost
        - request from M1 is slow
        - M2 crashes
        - M2 is slow to respond
        - response from M2 is slow or lost
        - Byzantine faults - corruput transmission / malicious response etc.
    - Timeout: not perfect mechanism
      - Idea: after a centain timeout, assume failure and retry
      - Problem: length of timeout is hard to determine. If we know that max delay is d and processing time is r, then we can set timtout = 2d + r. However, it's impossible to get an accurate value for d and r in real life, just statistics.
  - Why bother "distributed"?
    - Make things faster
    - Reliability (more copies of data)
    - Throughput
- Time
  - Computers have 2 kinds of physical clocks
    - Time of day clock
    - Monotonic clock
